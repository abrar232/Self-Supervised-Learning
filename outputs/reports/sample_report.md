# Sample Report (Illustrative)

This repository keeps the notebook output-free. To provide a quick visual summary, we include:

- `tsne_embeddings.png` — a small embedding scatter for demonstration
- `contrastive_loss_curve.png` — a smooth, declining loss curve (placeholder)
- `ssl_placeholder.json` — a tiny JSON with configuration notes

> Replace these with real artifacts if/when you run training.
